# koans_dataset
A kōan is a story, dialogue, or statement, which is used in Zen practive to provoke the "great doubt" and test a student's progress in Zen practice. 
Kōans collectively form a substantial body of literature studied by Zen practitioners and scholars worldwide. Kōan collections commonly referenced in English include The Blue Cliff Record, The Book of Equanimity, The Gateless Gate, The True Dharma Eye and The Iron Flute.

This dataset attempts to preprocess those collections. 
For now, only Blue Riff and Book of Equanimity are preprocessed. Next one is Gate.

At that time a certain monk asked, ,Since you do not abide within clarity, what do you preserve?' Chao Chou replied, ' don't know either.'

If it neither goes away nor stays, would it be right to give a seal [of approval] or not?' Then Elder Rohi came up and said, 'I have the activities of the iron ox. [However,] I ask you, Master, not to give me the seal.' Fuketsu said, 'I am accustomed to leveling the great ocean through fishing whales. But, alas, now I find instead a frog wriggling about in the mud.' Rohi stood there considering. Fuketsu shouted 'Kaatz!' and said, 'Why don't you say anything else, Elder?' Rohi was perplexed. Fuketsu hit him with his whisk and said, 'Do you remember what you said? Say something, I'll check it for you.' Rohi tried to say something. Fuketsu hit him again with his whisk. The Magistrate said, 'Buddha's law and the King's law are of the same nature.' Fuketsu said, 'What principle do you see in them?' The Magistrate said, 'If you do not make a decision where a decision should be made, you are inviting disorder.' Fuketsu descended from the rostrum. </li><li><strong> Daizui's 'Kalpa Fire' </strong> A monk asked Daizui, 'When the great kalpa fire bursts out, the whole universe will be destroyed.

A monk asked Ryûsai, 'When the great kalpa fire bursts out, the whole universe will be destroyed. I wonder if IT will also be destroyed or not.' Ryûsai said, 'Not destroyed.' The monk said, 'Why is it not destroyed?' Ryûsai said, 'Because it is the same as the whole universe.' </li><li><strong> Unmon's 'Pillar' </strong> Unmon, instructing the assembly, said, 'The old buddha and a pillar intersect each other.

The monk said, 'I am from Yû Province' Kyôzan said, 'Do you think of that place?' The monk said, 'I always do.' Kyôzan said, 'That which thinks is the mind. That which is thought about is the objective world. Within that are mountains, rivers and the great earth, towers, palaces, people, animals, and other things. Reflect upon the mind that thinks. Are there a lot of things there?' The monk said, 'I don't see anything at all there.' Kyôzan said, 'That's right for the stage of understanding, but not yet for the stage of personalization.' The monk said, 'Do you have any special advice, Master?' Kyôzan said, 'It is not right to say that there is or there is not. Your insight shows that you have obtained only one side of the mystery. Sitting down, putting on clothes – from now on you see by yourself.' </li><li><strong> Sanshô's 'Golden Scales' </strong> Sanshô asked Seppô, 'When a fish with golden scales has passed through the net, what should it get for food?'

Seppô said, 'The old monk is just too busy with temple affairs.' </li><li><strong> Fuketsu's 'Speck of Dust' </strong> Fuketsu, giving instruction, said, 'If one raises a speck of dust, the house and the nation prosper.

Kassan said, 'A chicken dwells in the phoenix nest. It's not of the same class. Go away.' Rakuho said, 'I have come from far away, hearing much about you. Please, Master, I beg you to guide me.' Kassan said, 'Before my eyes there is no you, and here there is no old monk.' Rakuho shouted, 'Kaatz!' Kassan said, 'Stop it, stop it. Don't be so careless and hasty. Clouds and the moon are the same; valleys and mountains are different from each other. It is not difficult to cut off the tongues of the people under heaven. But how can you make a tongueless person speak?' Rakuho said nothing. Kassan hit him. With this, Rakuho started to obey Kassan. </li><li><strong> Master Ba Is Ill </strong> Great Master Ba was seriously ill. The temple steward asked him, 'Master, how are you feeling these days?'

Unmon said, 'I thought I was Marquis White, but I find that here is Marquise Black.' </li><li><strong> Rakuho at His Deathbed </strong> When he was about to die, Rakuho addressed his assembly and said, 'I have one matter to ask you about. If you say 'yes' to this, you are putting another head on your own. If you say 'no,' you are looking for life by cutting off your head.' The head monk said, 'The green mountain always lifts up its legs; you don't need to carry a lantern in the daylight.' Rakuho said, 'What time is this to utter such a saying?' A senior monk named Genjô stepped forward and said, 'Apart from these two ways, I beg you, Master, not to ask.' Rakuho said, 'That's not enough. Say some more.' Genjô said, 'I cannot say it fully.' Rakuho said, 'I don't care whether or not you can say it fully.' Genjô said, 'I feel just like an attendant who has nothing to respond to his master.' That evening, Rakuho called Genjô to him and said, 'Your response today had something quite reasonable. You have to realize what our late master said, 'There are no dharmas before the eyes, Yet consciousness is before the eyes. IT is not the Dharma before the eyes, IT cannot be reached by eyes and ears.' Which phrase is the guest? Which phrase is the host? If you can sort them out, I will transmit the bowl and robe to you.' Genjô said, 'I don't understand.' Rakuho said, 'You must understand.' Genjô said, 'I really don't understand.' Rakuho uttered a kaatz and said, 'Miserable, miserable!' [Another] monk asked, 'What would you like to say, Master?' Rakuho said, 'The boat of compassion is not rowed over pure waves. It's been wasted labor releasing wooden geese down the precipitous strait.' </li><li><strong> Nanyô and the Water Jug </strong> A monk asked National Teacher Chû of Nanyô, 'What is the essential body of Vairocana Buddha?'

How will you treat him when he suddenly appears before you?' Master Hô said, 'Suparnin, the king of birds, absorbs the entire universe. Who can stick his head within him?' The monk said, 'But how about when he does appear?' Hô said, 'It is like a falcon catching a pigeon. If you don't realize it, you will learn the truth through the 'inspection before the balcony.'' The monk said, 'If so, then I'll fold my hands on my chest and retreat three steps.' Hô said, 'You black tortoise under the Sumeru altar. Don't wait to be struck on the forehead again and get hurt.' </li><li><strong> Four Phrases from the Engaku Sutra </strong> The Engaku Sutra says: 'At all times, you do not raise the delusive mind.

Where there is no understanding, you do not distinguish the truth.' </li><li><strong> Tokusan's 'Study Accomplished' </strong> Great Master Tokusan Emmyô instructed his assembly and said, 'If you have exhausted to the end, you will realize right away that all buddhas in the three worlds have stuck their mouths to the wall.

Manjusri said, 'I see it like this: in all phenomena, there are neither words nor explanations, neither presentations nor knowledge; it is beyond all questions and answers. That is what I understand with 'to enter the Dharma-gate of Not-Two'.' Then Manjusri asked Vimalakirti, 'All of us have finished giving our explanations. Now you should give your explanation. What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the Dharma-gate of Not-Two?' Vimalakirti remained silent. </li><li><strong> Tôzan and the Memorial Service </strong> When Tôzan held a memorial service for Ungan before his portrait, he mentioned the episode with the portrait. A monk came forward and asked, 'When Ungan said, 'Just this!' what did that mean?' Tôzan said, 'At that time, I almost misunderstood my master's meaning.' The monk said, 'I wonder whether or not Ungan really knew that IT is.' Tôzan said, 'If he did not know that it is, how could he say like that? If he knew that it is, how did he dare say like that?' </li><li><strong> Seppô's 'What Is This?' </strong> When Seppô was living in a hermitage, two monks came to pay their respects. When he saw them coming, Seppô thrust open the gate of his hermitage with his hands, jumped out, and said, 'What is this?' The monks also said, 'What is this?' Seppô hung his head and retired into his hermitage. Later, the monks came to Gantô. He asked them, 'Where have you come from?' The monks said, 'From Reinan.' Gantô said, 'Did you ever visit Seppô?' The monks said, 'Yes, we visited him.' Gantô said, 'What did he say?' The monks related what had happened. Gantô said, 'What else did he say?' The monks said, 'Not a word; he hung his head and retired into his hermitage.' Gantô said, 'Oh, how I regret now that in those days I did not tell him the last word! If I had told it to him, no one under heaven could do anything against him.' At the end of the summer practice period the monks came back to this conversation and asked him about its meaning. Gantô said, 'Why didn't you ask me about it sooner?' The monks said, 'We could not dare to ask you about it.' Gantô said, 'Seppô was born on the same stem as I, but he will not die on the same stem. If you want to know the last word, it is just this.' </li><li><strong> Hôgen's 'Boat or Land' </strong> Hôgen asked Senior Monk Kaku, 'Did you come by boat or by land?' Kaku said, 'By boat.'

Sôzan said, 'You put it in a nice way, but you were able to say only eighty percent.' Toku said, 'How about you, Master?' Sôzan said, 'It is like a well looking at a donkey.' </li><li><strong> Ôbaku's 'Drinkers' </strong> Ôbaku instructed the assembly and said, 'You are all drinkers of lees. If you continue to go on your Way like this, where will the 'Today' be? Do you know that in this great empire of Tang there is no Zen master?'

Ungan said, 'The whole body is hands and eyes.' Dôgo said, 'You said it very well. But you expressed only eight-tenths of it.' Ungan said, 'How would you say it, Elder Brother?' Dôgo said, 'The entire body is hands and eyes.' </li><li><strong> Seppô in Charge of Cooking </strong> Seppô came to Tokusan and became in charge of cooking food. One day, the lunch was late. Tokusan came down to the hall carrying his bowls. Seppô said, 'Old Master, the bell has not yet rung nor the drum sounded. Where are you going with your bowls?' Thereupon Tokusan went back to his room. Seppô told this to Gantô. Gantô said, 'Great Tokusan though he is, he has not yet realized the last word.' Hearing of this, Tokusan sent his attendant to summon Gantô and then asked him, 'Don't you approve of this old monk?' Gantô whispered his intention. Tokusan remained silent. Sure enough, the next day, when Tokusan ascended the rostrum, his talk was quite different from usual. Gantô, rubbing his hands together, laughed and said, 'Wonderful! How happy I am that our Old Man has realized the last word. From now on he'll be subject to no one on earth.' </li><li><strong> Misshi and the White Rabbit </strong> When Uncle Misshi and Tôzan were walking together, they saw a white rabbit run by in front of them.

The monk said, 'What if I don't run into it?' Seirin said, 'You have no place to escape from it.' The monk said, 'Precisely at such a time, what then?' Seirin said, 'It is lost.' The monk said, 'I wonder where it is gone.' Seirin said, 'The grass is so deep, there is no place to look for it.' The monk said, 'You too, Master, must be watchful in order to get it.'

Sozan said, 'I sold my clothes and other belongings, and made an arduous journey of one thousand miles to come to you. Why does Your Reverence make light of me?' Isan called his attendant and said, 'Bring some money and give it to this reverend monk for his travel expenses.' Finally he said, 'Some day a one-eyed dragon will let you open your eyes.' Later Sozan went to Myôshô and told him about this. Myôshô said, 'I can say that Isan is completely right, but he did not meet one who could appreciate him.' Sozan asked again, 'If the tree falls down and the wisteria withers, where will the words go?' Myôshô said, 'It would make Isan laugh again all the more.' Upon hearing this, Sozan gained realization. Then he said, 'From the beginning, there was a sword behind Isan's laughter.' </li><li><strong> 'Non-Seeing' in the Ryôgon Sutra </strong> The Ryôgon Sutra says, 'When I don't see, why do you not see what I do not see? If you argue that you see what I do not see, that is of course not what I do not see. If you do not see what I do not see, then it is quite natural that it is not a thing. Why is it not your self?' </li><li><strong> Tôzan's 'Place of No Grass' </strong> Tôzan instructed the assembly and said, 'At the beginning of autumn and the end of summer, you, brothers, are departing east and west. But you should go directly to the place of no grass over ten thousand miles.' And again he said, 'How will you go to the place of no grass over ten thousand miles?' Sekisô said, 'When you go out of the gate, there is grass!' Taiyô said, 'I would say: Even if you don't go out of the gate, grass is abundant everywhere.'' </li><li><strong> Kyôzan Speaks Out </strong> Master Kyôzan went to Maitreya's abode in a dream and was led to the second seat. A venerable monk said, 'Today the second seat is due to speak.' Kyôzan stood up, struck the stand with the gavel, and said, 'The Dharma of Mahayana is beyond the four propositions and transcends the hundred negations. I dare speak this!' </li><li><strong> Nansen and the Peonies</strong> Minister Rikukô said to Nansen, 'Dharma-teacher Jô is wonderful. He truly knows what he is talking about: 'Heaven and earth and I have one and the same root; all things and I are one single body.'' Nansen pointed at the peonies in the garden and said, 'Minister, people of our time see these flowers as in a dream.' </li><li><strong> Unmon's 'One Treasure'</strong> Unmon said, ''Within heaven and earth, in the midst of the universe, there is one treasure hidden in a body.' You take up the lantern and go to the Buddha Hall; you take the temple gate and put it on the lantern.' </li><li><strong> Roso Does Not Understand </strong> Roso asked Nansen, ''People do not recognize the Mani-jewel. I picked it up myself in the Tathagata treasury.'  What is this treasury?' Nansen said, 'Old Master O  exchanges questions and answers with you. That's it.' Shiso said, 'How about when there is no exchange of questions and answers?' Nansen said, 'That's also the treasury.' Shiso said, 'What is the jewel?' Nansen said, 'Reverend Shiso!' Shiso said, 'Yes!' Nansen said, 'Get out. You don't understand my words.' </li><li><strong> Tôzan Unwell </strong> Tôzan was unwell. A monk asked, 'Your Reverence is unwell. Is there anyone who does not become ill?' Tôzan said, 'There is.' The monk said, 'Does the one who does not get ill take  care of Your Reverence?' Tôzan said, 'The old monk is properly taking care of that one.' The monk said, 'How about when your Reverence takes care of that one?' Tôzan said, 'Then the old monk does not see that there is illness.' </li><li><strong> Rinzai Draws a Line </strong> Rinzai asked the temple steward, 'Where have you come from?' The temple steward said, 'From selling brown rice in the province.' Rinzai said, 'Did you sell all of it?' The manager said, 'Yes, I sold all of it.' Rinzai drew a line with his staff and said, 'Have you sold all of this too?' The manager shouted, 'Kaatz!' Rinzai immediately struck him. Later, the cook monk came to Rinzai, who told him about this incident. The monk said, 'The steward didn't understand Your Reverence's intention.' Rinzai said, 'How about you?' The monk made a deep bow. Rinzai struck him likewise. </li><li><strong> Kyûhô Does Not Acknowledge </strong> Kyûhô served Sekisô as his attendant. After Sekisô's passing, the assembly wanted to make their head monk the abbot of the temple. Kyûhô would not acknowledge him. He said, 'Wait till I examine him. If he understands our late master's spirit and intention, I will serve him as I served our late master.' So he asked the head monk, 'Our late master said, 'Have been totally ceased; Have been totally extinguished; [Have become a cool land of desolation;]  Have had only one awareness for ten thousand years; Have become cold ashes and a withered tree; [Have become a fragrant censer in an ancient shrine;] Have become a vertical stripe of white silk.' Tell me, what sort of matter did he clarify with this?' The head monk said, 'He clarified the matter of absolute Oneness.' Ho said, 'If so, you have not yet understood our late master's spirit.' The head monk said, 'Don't you acknowledge me? Pass me incense.' He lit the incense and said, 'If I had not understood our late master's spirit, I would not be able to pass away while the smoke of this incense rises.' No sooner had he said this than he expired while sitting in zazen. Kyûhô caressed his back and said, 'Dying while sitting or standing is not impossible. But you could not even dream of our late master's spirit.' </li><li><strong> Emperor Dôkô's Helmet Hood </strong> Emperor Dôkô spoke to Kôke saying, 'I have attained the treasure of the Central Plain. However, no one can set a price on it.' Kôke said, 'Your Majesty, please lend it to me so that I may see.' The emperor pulled the straps of his helmet hood with both hands. Kôke said, 'Who can dare to set a price on the emperor's treasure!' </li><li><strong> Tôzan's 'Intimate with It' </strong> A monk asked Tôzan, 'Among the three bodies [of Buddha], what body does not degenerate into numbers?' Tôzan said, 'I am always most intimate with it.' </li><li><strong> Unmon's 'Bowl and Pail' </strong> A monk asked Unmon, 'What is the dust-dust samadhi?' Unmon said, 'Rice in the bowl, water in the pail.' </li><li><strong> Rôya's 'Mountains and Rivers' </strong> A monk asked Master Kaku of Rôya, 'The essential state is pure and clear. How are mountains, rivers and the great earth produced at once?' Kaku said, 'The essential state is pure and clear. How are mountains, rivers and the great earth produced at once?'</li>
