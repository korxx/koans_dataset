# koans_dataset
A kōan is a story, dialogue, or statement, which is used in Zen practive to provoke the "great doubt" and test a student's progress in Zen practice. 
Kōans collectively form a substantial body of literature studied by Zen practitioners and scholars worldwide. Kōan collections commonly referenced in English include The Blue Cliff Record, The Book of Equanimity, The Gateless Gate, The True Dharma Eye and The Iron Flute.

This dataset attempts to preprocess those collections. 
Blue Riff, Book of Equanimity and The Gateless Gate are preprocessed. Next one The True Dharma Eye.
There are around 250 examples (koans) in this dataset, for now.

'no one was sick or died,' wondered the monks. 'what does our roshi mean?' after they had eaten, hyakujo led them to the foot of a rock on the furthest side of the mountain, and with his staff poked the dead body of a fox and had it ritually cremated. in the evening hyakujo gave a talk to the monks and told them this story of the law of karma. upon hearing the story, obaku asked hyakujo, 'you said that because a long time ago an old zen master gave a wrong answer he became a fox for 500 rebirths. but suppose every time he answered he had not made a mistake, what would have happened then?' hyakujo replied, 'just come here to me, and i will tell you the answer!' obaku then went up to hyakujo--and slapped the teacher's face. hyakujo, clapping his hands and laughing, exclaimed, 'i thought the persian had a red beard, but here is another one with a red beard!' </li><li><strong> gutei's finger </strong> gutei raised his finger whenever he was asked a question about zen. a boy attendant began to imitate him in this way. when a visitor asked the boy what his master had preached about, the boy raised his finger. gutei heard about the boy's mischief, seized him and cut off his finger with a knife. as the boy screamed and ran out of the room, gutei called to him. when the boy turned his head to gutei, gutei raised up his own finger. in that instant the boy was enlightened. when gutei was about to die, he said to the assembled monks,'i received this one-finger zen from tenryu. i used it all my life and yet could not exhaust it' and then he passed away. </li><li><strong>  waku'an's 'why no beard?'  </strong> waku'an (looking at bodhidharma's picture) complained, 'why has that barbarian no beard?' </li><li><strong> kyogen's man hanging in the tree </strong> kyogen said, 'it (zen) is like a man (monk) hanging by his teeth in a tree over a precipice. his hands grasp no branch, his feet rest on no limb, and under the tree another man asks him, 'why did bodhidharma come to china from the west (india)?' if the man in the tree does not answer, he misses the question, and if he answers, he falls and loses his life. now what shall he do?'  </li><li><strong> the buddha's flower </strong> once upon a time when buddha was in grdhrakuta mountain, he twirled a flower in his finger and held it before his congregation. everyone was silent. only maha kashapa wholeheartedly smiled. buddha said, 'i have the eye of the true teaching, the heart of nirvana, the formless form, the mysterious gate of dharma. beyond the words and beyond all teachings to be transmitted, i now pass this on to maha kashapa.' </li><li><strong> joshu's washing the bowl </strong> a monk told joshu, 'i have just entered this monastery. i beg you to teach me.' joshu asked, 'have you eaten your rice porridge?' the monk replied, 'i have.'

'what have you realized?' asked ryutan to tokusan, who replied, 'from now on i will not doubt what you have said.' the next day ryutan ascended the rostrum and declared to the monks, 'among you there is one monk whose teeth are like the sword tree, his mouth is like the blood bowl. strike him with a stick, he won't turn his head to look at you. some day he will climb the highest peaks and carry out my teaching there.' on that day, in front of the lecture hall, tokusan burned to ashes his commentaries on the sutras and declared, 'in comparison to this awareness, all the most profound
